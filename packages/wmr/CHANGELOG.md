* [`08d66e3`](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/commit/08d66e3799644a626af48208098bfa96959d7409) [#604](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/pull/604) Thanks [@rschristian](https://github.com/rschristian)! - Ensuring .d.ts files aren't copied to build output

- [`ba40f5c`](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/commit/ba40f5c6c2056867dbbc3eb3def5102103a031b5) [#610](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/pull/610) Thanks [@rschristian](https://github.com/rschristian)! - Fixes some of WMR's CLI flags labelled as global when they're not

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [`0a9cbe8`](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/commit/0a9cbe808f38aab10f15fb8f3e51cde8b3e37e37) [#596](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/pull/596) Thanks [@rschristian](https://github.com/rschristian)! - WMR was published missing `"type": "module"` which immediately broke new projects due to the `wmr.config.mjs`

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`7561dc7`](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/commit/7561dc7b5f3e2604ef0bf51ec4b337633bfc70d7) [#576](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/pull/576) Thanks [@marvinhagemeister](https://github.com/marvinhagemeister)! - Rework prerendering API for tags in `document.head`. Previously the API is based on a subset of the actual `document.head` object. But in supplying a `document` global we rendered third party library checks invalid which usually use a variant of `typeof document === "undefined"` to determine if they're in a server environment or not. Since every library uses a different subset of the DOM API, it's impossible to support everyone. Instead using the server code paths of those libraries is a much more reliable approach.

  Any tags that should land in `document.head` can be added to the return value of the `prerender` function:

  ```js
  export async function prerender(data) {
  	// ...do your prerendering here

  	return {
  		// The string that is put inside <body>
  		html: '<h1>Hello world</h1>',
  		head: {
  			// sets document.title
  			title: 'My Cool Title',
  			// Sets the lang attribute on the <html> element
  			lang: 'en',
  			// Any element you want to put into document.head
  			elements: [
  				{ type: 'link', props: { rel: 'stylesheet', href: '/path/to/my/style.css' } },
  				{ type: 'meta', props: { property: 'og:title', content: 'Become an SEO Expert' } }
  			]
  		}
  	};
  }
  ```
