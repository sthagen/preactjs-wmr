Options
  --cwd            The working directory - equivalent to "(cd FOO && wmr)"

  -v, --version    Displays current version
  -h, --help       Displays this message

## Start

The `start` command fires up a development server. In addition to serving your files, it watches for changes to those files, passes them through WMR's plugin system and applies the result in your browser. It's the main mode of WMR where you'll spend most of your time in.

To list additional command line options available in this mode, enter:

```sh
npx wmr start --help
```

List of additional options:

### --port, -p

- Type: `number`
- Default: `8080`

The port to start the development server on. To run the server on port 3000 use: `wmr --port 3000`.

### --host

- Type: `string`
- Default: `localhost`

The hostname to listen on. The default is `localhost`, meaning your app will be accessible on that machine under `http://localhost:8080/`.

To allow other machines to access the development server use `--host 0.0.0.0`. This will make the server discoverable publicly for everyone.

> Important: Only the `Network:` address is accessible to others. The `Local:` address is still private to you.

### --http2

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

Use HTTP/2 instead of HTTP/1.

### --compress

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`

Enable compression when serving responses.

### --reload

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

Disable HMR (=hot module reloading) and always do a full page reload when applying updates in the browser.

## Build

The `build` command generates a production build of your application. It enables additional minification plugins that work hard to make your application as small as possible.

To list additional command line options available in this mode, enter:

```sh
npx wmr build --help
```

### --out

- Type: `string`
- Default: `dist/`

The folder to store the generated files after a successful build.

### --prerender

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

Generate static HTML from all pages of your app. See the [Prerendering](/docs/prerendering) chapter for more information.

### --sourcemap

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

Generate Source Map files.

### --visualize

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

Launch an interactive bundle visualizer to inspect which libraries were included in your bundles. This is commonly used to get a picture of the cost of certain libraries and find areas for size improvements.

## Serve

The `serve` command starts a production web server using the files generated by the `build` command. Unlike the development server, this `serve` doesn't support any form of HMR. It's mainly useful for performance testing and ensuring prerendering is working optimally.

This command supports the same options as the [`start`](#start) command.
